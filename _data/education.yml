- degree: Studies in Chemistry
  uni: University of Costa Rica
  year: 2014 &mdash; actually
  award: Forme vicepresident (2016-2017) student committee and co-funder student chapter of the American Chemical Society
  summary: In this period I develop my experimental laboratory skills. I am qualified to quantify analytes in the classical analytical chemistry techniques such as titration analysis and also in the modern techniques of intrumental analysis such as gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 
           I have knowledge of Ultraviolet – visible spectroscopy and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. I also have knowledge of high vacuum techniques (Air-Sensitive Techniques)
           I also developed my abilities in linear and polynomial modeling to explain physicochemical phenomena.
           In my spare time I developed my leadership, project planning and service skills. To accomplish that, I was an active member of our school’s student committee as a former vice president. Among my favorite projects is the Chemical Show, a show of experiments that sought to motivate children to study science and engineering careers. We were able to reach more than 2000 children from various parts of the country. 
           On the other hand, I founded the Laboratory Induction, a project whose objective was to prepare students for their laboratory course. A total success, more than 5000 beneficiaries improved their experience. 
           We concluded our period by founding the first student chapter of the American Chemical Society in Costa Rica.
