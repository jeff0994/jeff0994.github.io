  summary:  <br> I focused on the area of computational physics and materials science.</br>
            
            <br/><b>Computational Techniques:</b> <mark>Linux</mark> <mark>Git</mark> <mark>Python</mark> <mark>C</mark> 
            <br/>
            <br/>I developed projects for calculating uncertainties via Monte Carlo simulation or by estimating uncertainties by the analytical methods for different physical models.
            <br/>
            <br/> In this period I focus on data science and machine learning by taking various online courses. 
                  Also I learned how to use and integrate Pandas and SQL for data analysis by carrying out projects that seek to answer questions from physics or from everyday life.
            <br/>
            <br/><b>Research:</b> Our research deals with quantum error correction using neural networks.

  summary: <br> In this period I develop my experimental and modeling skills.</br>
  
           <br/><b>Lab Techniques:</b> <mark>Volumetric Analysis</mark> <mark>Instrumental Analysis</mark> <mark>Gas Chromatography</mark> <mark>HPLC</mark>
           <mark>UV-vis Spectroscopy</mark> <mark>Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy</mark> <mark>Air-Sensitive Techniques</mark><br>
           
           <br/><b>Linear modeling:</b> I also developed my abilities in linear and polynomial modeling to explain physicochemical phenomena. Here I fell in love with data management.

           <br/>
           <b>Leadership, project planning and service skills:</b> I was an active member of our schoolâ€™s student committee as a former vice president. Among my favorite projects is the <b>Chemical Show</b>, a show of experiments that sought to motivate children to study science and engineering careers. We were able to reach more than 2000 children from various parts of the country. 
           On the other hand, I founded the <b>Laboratory Induction</b>, a project whose objective was to prepare students for their laboratory course. A total success, more than 5000 beneficiaries improved their experience. 
           We concluded our period by founding the first student chapter of the American Chemical Society in Costa Rica.
