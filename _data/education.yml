  summary: In this period I develop my experimental laboratory skills <br>
           __Lab Techniques:__ <mark>Volumetric analysis( titrations)</mark> <mark>Instrumental analysis</mark> <mark>gas chromatography</mark> <mark>high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)</mark>
           <mark>ltraviolet – visible spectroscopy UV-vis</mark> <mark>Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy</mark> <mark>High vacuum techniques (Air-Sensitive Techniques)<mark>
  
           __Linear modeling:__ I also developed my abilities in linear and polynomial modeling to explain physicochemical phenomena. Here I fell in love with data management <br>
           
           __Leadership, project planning and service skills:__ I was an active member of our school’s student committee as a former vice president. Among my favorite projects is the Chemical Show, a show of experiments that sought to motivate children to study science and engineering careers. We were able to reach more than 2000 children from various parts of the country. 
           On the other hand, I founded the Laboratory Induction, a project whose objective was to prepare students for their laboratory course. A total success, more than 5000 beneficiaries improved their experience. 
           We concluded our period by founding the first student chapter of the American Chemical Society in Costa Rica.
